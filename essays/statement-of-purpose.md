From a young age, I enjoyed learning about mathematics and foreign
languages, which I explored in my high school coursework. As a mix of
mathematics and languages, computer science naturally appealed to
me. In pursuit of this interest, I began teaching myself C/C++ and PHP
through online resources. My interest grew even more when I used Linux
for the first time, and was able to enhance my interactions with
computer systems. These were enriching experiences since it was my
first time investing so much efforts in science on my own volition. 
Following my graduation from high school, I decided to work towards an
engineering degree.

The first part of my studies involved acquiring a strong background in
mathematics and physics. I chose to specialize in computer science,
and was introduced to the CAML language, which provided
me my first theoretical aspects in this field. Later, I was accepted at
the Ecole Centrale Lyon Engineering School, where I learned to apply
my knowledge to problem solving in engineering, and more particularly
in signal processing, biological systems modeling, computer graphics,
and bioinformatics.

In my third year of engineering school, I decided to take a year off
to validate my career objectives by doing research internships in
various laboratories. My first internship was in the Astrophysics
Department of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy
Commission where I used wavelet decomposition algorithms to
denoise telescope images. Working on this project was really impactful
because it was my first experience doing research. I found that I
really enjoyed the autonomy that I was given in my work and the
everyday interactions with my peers that provided me insights about
the latest trends in related fields. Then, I joined a collaborative
effort between an acoustician and a computer scientist at two
different institutions, l’Ecole Nationale Superieure de Techniques
Avancées de Bretagne (Brest, France) and Scripps Institute of
Oceanography (San Diego, California, USA). Our goal was to localize
whales using a time-frequency analysis of their calls. I really
enjoyed working on this project because of the interdisciplinary
approaches and heterogenous background of my mentors. Finally, my
end-of-study internship in Sanofi Pasteur (Marcy l’étoile, France)
gave me the opportunity to work in the pharmaceutical industry,
where I learned to use machine learning methods to predict a
vaccine response.

Many aspects of computer science are appealing to me, and more
particularly machine learning approaches. I enjoy combining
probability theory and computer science to describe or predict
patterns in data, and biology provides many opportunities to do
so. Moreover, this field keeps evolving at a very fast pace and the
flow of new ideas is very stimulating for creative research. My
involvement in the data science institute in the University of Hawaiʻi
at Mānoa with Dr. Mahdi Belcaid helps me strengthen my knowledge
in this field, and my various collaboration with biological
oceanography labs in the university provides me valuable
experience analyzing and curating the data. Already, my current
research tries to makes use of deep learning models to cluster genomic
sequences in metagenomic samples.

In the future, I want my research to support other scientific fields
through the development of data analysis tools and machine learning
approaches.
